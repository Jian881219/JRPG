# JRPG

## Summary
The purpose of this project is the development of a 2D, JRPG-style game. Planned features include classic elements of JRPG games such as turn-based combat, map exploration and NPC interaction. This project was not begun to create a profit or to innovate the RPG genre. Rather, it was created as a fun way to practice software development.

## Current Status
Currently, the core features of the game are being implemented with the goal of releasing a short demo to showcase these features. These core features include player movement, ability to talk to NPCs, basic turn-based combat, basic enemy AI and some special moves for combat. The demo is on pace to be finished late August to early September 2016.

## Development
In order to view the game to play it and experiment with the code for it, Unity software must be used. It can be downloaded from unity3d.com (the Personal Edition is free). In Unity, the folder 'JRPGUnityProject' must be opened as a Unity Project.
