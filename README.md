# JRPG

## Summary
The purpose of this project is the development of a 2D, JRPG-style game. Planned features include classic elements of JRPG games such as turn-based combat, map exploration and NPC interaction. This project was not begun to make a profit or to innovate the RPG genre. Rather, it was created just for fun and also as a way to practice software development.

## Current Status
A release has recently been finished! This takes the form of a short playable demo meant to show core features implemented so far, including player movement, ability to talk to NPCs, basic turn-based combat, basic enemy AI and some special moves for combat. More information, as well as an executable file to play the game, can be found at the following link. https://github.com/seanlazaro/JRPG/releases/tag/1.0.0

## Development and Documentation
In order to view the game to play it or experiment with the code for it, Unity software must be used. It can be downloaded from unity3d.com (the Personal Edition is free). In Unity, the folder 'JRPGUnityProject' must be opened as a Unity Project. 

Documentation for the code can be viewed at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccAKMaFjKPZXAVrcS6KL1YWx5OrgFkFmKw90K4Itdk0/edit?usp=sharing
